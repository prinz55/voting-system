Voting System in Python

Overview
This is a simple command-line voting system built in Python. It allows registered voters to cast their votes for one of two candidates. The system ensures that only eligible voters can vote and prevents duplicate voting. After all registered voters have voted, the system counts the votes and declares the winner.

Features
✔️ User-friendly interface for voting
✔️ Input validation to ensure correct voter IDs and votes
✔️ Prevents duplicate voting
✔️ Automatically counts votes and declares the winner
✔️ Runs in a continuous loop until all voters have voted

How It Works
The system displays the list of candidates.
A voter enters their Voter ID to verify eligibility.
If eligible, the voter selects 1 for Donald Trump or 2 for Kamala Harris.
If an invalid choice is made, the system asks again until a correct vote is entered.
After all voters have voted, the system counts the votes and declares the winner.

Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries required
